## 001 — 2026-09-10T00:26Z — Track 1, Policy administration

**Decision.** Track 1.

**Why.** Domain command is the largest single scoring bucket (30/100) and is
graded on precision of vocabulary under questioning, not on novelty. I already
carry working insurance vocabulary — carrier vs. broker vs. MGA economics,
risk retention groups under the LRRA, filed-and-approved rate regulation,
coverage anchoring and inflation guards — from building a replacement-cost
underinsurance scoring product on the SF assessor roll. Track 1 lets me spend
the 48 hours on mechanics rather than on learning what a premium is.

Track 1's money mechanics also collide directly with the hardest
non-negotiables. Pro-rata unearned premium on a mid-term cancellation is
exactly the "someone has to eat the penny" case in requirement 9, and a
backdated endorsement is exactly the reversal-plus-rebook case in requirement 5.
Those two land in the same ledger, so correctness there compounds instead of
splitting my attention.

**Considered and rejected.** Track 3 (neobank) has the flashier integration
surface — the authorize-then-capture-a-different-amount asymmetry on Lithic is
a genuinely good demo. I rejected it because the domain depth I would have to
fake is larger than the demo advantage I would gain. Track 2 (investing) needs
tax lots and T+1 corporate actions, which is the most domain to learn per hour
of the three.

**Risk accepted.** Track 1 is the product Corgi runs today, so it is graded by
people who know every shortcut I might take. I am treating that as the reason
to pick it, not the reason to avoid it.
